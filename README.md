# Biodiversity-Dashboard-using-Plotly

# Overview and Findings

Plotly provides graphing, analytics, and statistics tools, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino, and REST. Plotly is an open-source library that provides a list of chart types as well as tools with callbacks to make a dashboard. The charts we have constructed and embedded are all made in chart studio of plotly. When Mrs. Roza came to us, she had partially completed a dashboard. A completed panel for demographic information allows for a user-friendly convenience. We have constructed a chart to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer allowing them to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. Furnishing this information will allow Improbable Beef the ability to identify a species, as a candidate, to manufacture synthetic beef. The volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. The interactive dashboard explores the details. We built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
